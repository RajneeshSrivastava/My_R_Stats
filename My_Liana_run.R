#CCC Resources
#liana provides CCC resources obtained and formatted via OmnipathR which are then converted to the appropriate format to each method.

# Resource currently included in OmniPathR (and hence `liana`) include:
#show_resources()
#Note that the different algorithms (or scoring measures) used in sca, natmi, connectome, cellphonedb, cytotalkâ€™s crosstalk scores, and logfc were re-implemented in LIANA. Yet, the original method pipelines can be called via the call_* functions.

##liana wrapper function
#liana takes Seurat and SingleCellExperiment objects as input, containing processed counts and clustered cells.
liana_path <- system.file(package = "liana")
#testdata <-readRDS(file.path(liana_path , "testdata", "input", "testdata.rds"))
#testdata %>% dplyr::glimpse()
##### liana_wrap calls a number of methods and and each method is run with the provided resource(s).
# Run liana
liana_test <- liana_wrap(testdata)

## Liana returns a list of results, each element of which corresponds to a method
liana_test %>% dplyr::glimpse()

#LIANA currently provides a mixture of re-implemented methods and pipelines which externally call specific LR methods. By default, LIANA will call only the internal scoring function, i.e. those that are re-implemented in LIANA.
#One can use LIANA to also run the original methods. For more about the original methods see LIANA++.

#Aggregate and Obiain Consensus Ranks
## liana also provides consensus ranks for the results obtained using different methods. By default, liana will provide mean, median, and aggregate* consensus ranks

# We can aggregate these results into a tibble with consensus ranks
liana_test <- liana_test %>% liana_aggregate()
dplyr::glimpse(liana_test)

#Simple DotPlot
liana_test %>%
  liana_dotplot(source_groups = c("B"),
                target_groups = c("NK", "CD8 T", "B"),
                ntop = 20)

#Frequency Heatmap
liana_trunc <- liana_test %>%
   # only keep interactions concordant between methods
  filter(aggregate_rank <= 0.01) # this can be FDR-corr if n is too high
